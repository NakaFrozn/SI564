3. As you can see from the description of the `account` table above, the status of the accounts can be ACTIVE, CLOSED or FROZEN. But in the `account` table, the accounts are all ACTIVE.

I also created the data dictionaries for the tables mentioned above: `account`, `employee`, `transaction`, and `branch`. You can find the data dictionary in each sheet in the Excel file which is attached to this email. Please let me know if you have any questions or additional data request for the next steps. 

For Raj's question, it took me about half to an hour to complete the task and create the data dictionaries. I haven't heard from him about his farm business yet. But it really sounds interesting to run a farm!

Thank you again!

Best,
Jonas
